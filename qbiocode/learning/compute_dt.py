        data_key (str): Key for the dataset, if applicable.
        criterion (str): The function to measure the quality of a split. Default is 'gini'.
        splitter (str): The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Default is 'best'.
        max_depth (int or None): The maximum depth of the tree. Default is None.

        min_weight_fraction_leaf (float): The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights required to be at a leaf node. Default is 0.0.
        max_features (int, float, str or None): The number of features to consider when looking for the best split. Default is None.
        random_state (int or None): Controls the randomness of the estimator. Default is None.
        max_leaf_nodes (int or None): Grow a tree with max_leaf_nodes in best-first fashion. Default is None.
        min_impurity_decrease (float): A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value. Default is 0.0.
        class_weight (dict or 'balanced' or None): Weights associated with classes in the form {class_label: weight}. Default is None.
        ccp_alpha (float): Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. Default is 0.0.

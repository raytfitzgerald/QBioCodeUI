    This function generates a model using a Random Forest (RF) Classifier method as implemented in
    `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html>`_.
    It takes in parameter arguments specified in the config.yaml file, but will use the default parameters specified above if none are passed.
    The model is trained on the training dataset and validated on the test dataset. The function returns the evaluation of the model 
    on the test dataset, including accuracy, AUC, F1 score, and the time taken to train and validate the model.
    This function is designed to be used in a supervised learning context, where the goal is to classify data points.

        y_train (array-like): Training data labels.
        y_test (array-like): Test data labels.
        args (dict): Additional arguments, typically from a configuration file.

        criterion (str): The function to measure the quality of a split, default is 'gini'.
        max_depth (int or None): Maximum depth of the tree, default is None.
        min_samples_split (int): Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node, default is 2.
        min_samples_leaf (int): Minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node, default is 1.
        min_weight_fraction_leaf (float): Minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights required to be at a leaf node, default is 0.0.
        max_features (str or int or float): The number of features to consider when looking for the best split, default is 'sqrt'.
        max_leaf_nodes (int or None): Grow trees with max_leaf_nodes in best-first fashion, default is None.
        min_impurity_decrease (float): A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity greater than or equal to this value, default is 0.0.
        bootstrap (bool): Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees, default is True.
        oob_score (bool): Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the generalization accuracy, default is False.
        n_jobs (int or None): Number of jobs to run in parallel for both `fit` and `predict`, default is None.
        random_state (int or None): Controls the randomness of the estimator, default is None.
        warm_start (bool): When set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit and add more estimators to the ensemble, default is False.
        class_weight (dict or str or None): Weights associated with classes in the form {class_label: weight}, default is None.
        ccp_alpha (float): Complexity parameter used for Minimal
     Returns:
        modeleval (dict): A dictionary containing the evaluation metrics of the model, including accuracy, AUC, F1 score, and the time taken for training and validation.

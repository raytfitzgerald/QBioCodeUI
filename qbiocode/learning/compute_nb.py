    """This function generates a model using a Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB) Classifier method as implemented in

    It takes in parameter arguments specified in the config.yaml file, but will use the default parameters specified above if none are passed.
    The model is trained on the training dataset and validated on the test dataset. The function returns the evaluation of the model 
    on the test dataset, including accuracy, AUC, F1 score, and the time taken to train and validate the model.
    This function is designed to be used in a supervised learning context, where the goal is to classify data points.

        y_test (numpy.ndarray): Test labels.
        args (dict): Additional arguments, such as config parameters.
        verbose (bool): If True, prints additional information during execution.
        model (str): Name of the model being used.
        data_key (str): Key for the dataset, if applicable.

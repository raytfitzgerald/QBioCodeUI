    This function generates a model using an Extreme Gradient Boositing (xgb) Classifier method as implemented in xgboost. It takes in parameter
    arguments specified in the config.yaml file, but will use the default parameters specified above if none are passed.  
    The model is trained on the training dataset and validated on the test dataset. The function returns the evaluation of the model 
    on the test dataset, including accuracy, AUC, F1 score, and the time taken to train and validate the model.
    This function is designed to be used in a supervised learning context, where the goal is to classify data points.

    Args:
        X_train (array-like): Training data features.
        X_test (array-like): Test data features.
        y_train (array-like): Training data labels.
        y_test (array-like): Test data labels.
        args (dict): Additional arguments, typically from a configuration file.
        verbose (bool): If True, prints additional information during execution.
        model (str): Name of the model being used, default is 'XGBoost'.
        data_key (str): Key for identifying the dataset, default is an empty string.
        n_estimators (int): Number of trees in the forest, default is 100.
        max_depth (int or None): Maximum depth of the tree, default is None.
        subsample (float) : Subsample ratio of the training instances. Default 0.5
        learning_rate (float): Step size shrinkage used in update to prevent overfitting. Default is 0.5
        colsample_bytree  (float): subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree. Default is 1
        min_child_weight (int) : Minimum sum of instance weight (hessian) needed in a child. Default is 1
     Returns:
        modeleval (dict): A dictionary containing the evaluation metrics of the model, including accuracy, AUC, F1 score, and the time taken for training and validation.

    This function generates a model using an Extreme Gradient Boositing (xgb) Classifier method as implemented in xgboost.
    The difference here is that this function runs a grid search. The range of the grid search for each parameter is specified in the config.yaml file. The
    combination of parameters that led to the best performance is saved and returned as best_params, which can then be used on similar
    datasets, without having to run the grid search.
    The model is trained on the training dataset and validated on the test dataset. The function returns the evaluation of the model 
    on the test dataset, including accuracy, AUC, F1 score, and the time taken to train and validate the model across the grid search.

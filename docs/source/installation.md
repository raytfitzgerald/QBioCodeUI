 This project has been tested and is compatible with Python versions 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12. While it might work on other versions, these are the officially supported and tested ones.

# Getting Started


Before you can run this project, you need to have python installed on your system

## Option 1: Setting up a Python Virtual Enviroment (venv)

This is the standard way to create an isolated Python enviroment.

**Steps:**

1. **Install pip (if you don't have it):**
  ```bash
   python -m ensurepip --default-pip
  ```
  or on some systems:
 ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3-pip
  ```
2. **Create a virtual enviroment:**
```bash
   python -m venv venv
  ```
This command creatas a new directory named `venv` (you can choose a different name if you prefer) containing a copy of the Python interpreter and necessary supporting files.

3. **Activate the virtual enviroment:**
* **On macOS and Linux:**
```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
* **On Windows (command promt):**
```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
* **On Windows (PowerShell):**
```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```
Once the activated, you'll see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal promt.

4. **Install project dependencies:**
   Once the virtual enviroment is activated, you can install the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
  ```bash
  pip install  .
  ```
5. **Deactivate the virtual enviroment (when you are done):**
   ```bash
    deactivate
   ```
   This will return you to your base Python enviroment.

## Option 2: Setting up a Conda Enviroment

1. Create the environment from the `requirements.txt` file.  This can be done using anaconda, miniconda, miniforge, or any other environment manager.
```
conda create -n qbc python==3.12

```
* Note: if you receive the error `bash: conda: command not found...`, you need to install some form of anaconda to your development environment.
2. Activate the new environment:
```
conda activate qbc
pip install .
```
3. Verify that the new environment and packages were installed correctly:
```
conda env list
pip list
```

## Option 3: Using Galaxy (Cloud-Based, No Local Installation)

If you prefer not to install QBioCode on your local or personal machine, you can use [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/), a free, web-based platform for data-intensive biomedical research.

```{admonition} Why Galaxy?
:class: tip
- **No installation required**: Run everything in your browser
- **Free computational resources**: Access to cloud computing
- **Jupyter notebook support**: Run QBioCode tutorials directly
- **Persistent workspace**: Your work is saved in the cloud
```

### Step 1: Register for a Galaxy Account

1. Go to [https://usegalaxy.org/](https://usegalaxy.org/)
2. Click **"Login or Register"** in the top menu
3. Select **"Register"** and fill in:
   - Email address
   - Password
   - Public name (username)
4. Click **"Create"** to complete registration
5. Verify your email address (check your inbox for confirmation link)

### Step 2: Launch a Jupyter Notebook Server

1. **Log in** to your Galaxy account at [https://usegalaxy.org/](https://usegalaxy.org/)

2. From the top menu, select **"Interactive Tools"**

3. Search for **"Jupyter Notebook"** or **"JupyterLab"**

4. Click on the Jupyter tool to launch it

5. Configure the notebook environment:
   - **Select Python version**: Choose Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12
   - **Allocate resources**: Default settings are usually sufficient
   - Click **"Execute"** or **"Run Tool"**

6. Wait for the notebook server to start (this may take 1-2 minutes)

7. Once ready, click the **link** to open your Jupyter environment in a new tab

### Step 3: Install QBioCode in Galaxy Jupyter

Once your Jupyter notebook server is running:

1. **Open a new terminal** in Jupyter:
   - Click **"File" → "New" → "Terminal"** (in JupyterLab)
   - Or use the **"New" → "Terminal"** button (in classic Jupyter)

2. **Install QBioCode** using Option 1 (pip install):

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/IBM/QBioCode.git
   cd QBioCode
   
   # Install QBioCode
   pip install .
   ```

3. **Verify installation**:

   ```bash
   python -c "import qbiocode; print('QBioCode installed successfully!')"
   ```

### Step 4: Run QBioCode Tutorials

1. **Navigate to the tutorial directory**:

   ```bash
   cd tutorial
   ```

2. **Open a tutorial notebook**:
   - In the Jupyter file browser, navigate to `QBioCode/tutorial/`
   - Click on any tutorial notebook to open it:
     - `QProfiler/example_qprofiler.ipynb`
     - `QSage/qsage.ipynb`
     - `Artificial_data_generation/example_data_generation.ipynb`
     - `Quantum_Projection_Learning/QPL_example.ipynb`

3. **Run the tutorial**:
   - Execute cells sequentially using **Shift+Enter**
   - Follow the instructions in each notebook

### Tips for Using Galaxy

```{tip}
**Best Practices:**
- **Save your work frequently**: Use File → Save to preserve your progress
- **Download important results**: Export notebooks and data files to your local machine
- **Monitor resource usage**: Galaxy sessions have time limits; plan accordingly
- **Use version control**: Consider connecting to GitHub for better workflow management
```

```{warning}
**Important Limitations:**
- Galaxy sessions may timeout after inactivity (typically 1-2 hours)
- Computational resources are shared; quantum simulations may be slower
- Large datasets may require local installation for better performance
- IBM Quantum hardware access requires separate IBM Quantum account setup
```

### Troubleshooting Galaxy Installation

**Issue: pip install fails**
```bash
# Try upgrading pip first
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install .
```

**Issue: Import errors**
```bash
# Restart the kernel: Kernel → Restart Kernel
# Then re-import
import qbiocode
```

**Issue: Session timeout**
- Save your work regularly
- Download notebooks before closing
- Restart the interactive tool if needed

### Alternative: Google Colab

Another cloud-based option is [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/):

```python
# In a Colab notebook cell:
!git clone https://github.com/IBM/QBioCode.git
%cd QBioCode
!pip install .
```

Then upload tutorial notebooks from the `tutorial/` directory.

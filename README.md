QBioCode has been tested and is compatible with Python versions 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12. While it might work on other versions, these are the officially supported and tested ones.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you need to have python installed on your system. Please follow the documentation provided [here](https://ibm.github.io/QBioCode/installation.html).

## Apps

The **QBioCode** framework allows for the development of several applications for analyzing HCLS data. Here is a list of applications developed so far:

- [QProfiler](https://ibm.github.io/QBioCode/apps/profiler.html) utilizes a novel CML and QML model profiling system based on various data complexity measures on the original data as well as linear and non-linear lower-dimensional embeddings of the data. Details can be found [here](https://ibm.github.io/QBioCode/apps/profiler.html)

- QSage guides model selection based on the input data complexity metrics and model performance across various datasets. It allows the user to rank CML and QML models for an unseen dataset.

## Tutorials

We have provided tutorial notebooks on:

- QProfiler usage including artificial data generation

- QSage usage to train model selection tool

- Quantum Projection Learning execution with classical baseline comparisons.
